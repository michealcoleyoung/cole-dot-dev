This section is dedicated to recording my job progress. In an effort to make this as simple and practical as I can I only included the essentials which are the Date Applied, Company, Position, Source, Status, Result, Notes and Follow-Up. 

> [!NOTE]
> This does not include the many positions that I applied to before I started documenting this.
