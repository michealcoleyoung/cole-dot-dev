## On ATS and Tailored Resumes
I recently had an idea that I thought might be beneficial when it comes to the idea of tailoring a resume to a specific job description. Instead of tailoring your whole resume to fit within the confines of Applicant Tracking Systems I think it would be best to just add a dedicated section of your resume that accounts for checking off all the keywords that are listed in the job description of the position you are applying for. What I mean by this is not to just add keywords relevant to the job description just to appease the ATS so you end up at the top of the pile of resumes to be reviewed. What I mean is to treat this dedicated section as kind of a cover letter to account for whatever is not mentioned in the core parts of your resume. This way you will not have to worry about adjusting each bullet point of every position you worked for at every company just to get the green light from the ATS.
