Welcome to cole.dev! This document includes all of my coding project notes using Obsidian. For each project you will find all of my personal notes, thought processes etc. that go into everything I build. In addition to this I've included a section for my career as a developer which you can find in the career directory. My hope is that this will not only be entertaining but informative and helpful. There are many great things on the horizon and I look forward to you being a part of it.
