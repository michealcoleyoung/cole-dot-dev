# Cornell Quick Notes

A web application built with Flask to implement the Cornell Note-Taking Method. This app helps users organize their notes efficiently and effectively.

## Description

Cornell Quick Notes provides a simple and intuitive interface for creating and managing notes using the Cornell Note-Taking System. This system encourages active learning and better retention by dividing notes into three distinct sections:

*   **Cue Column (Main Points):** Keywords, questions, or prompts related to the main content.
*   **Note-Taking Column (Notes):** Detailed notes taken during lectures, readings, or meetings.
*   **Summary Box (Summary):** A concise summary of the key takeaways.

This application aims to provide a digital alternative to traditional paper-based Cornell notes, offering features like easy editing, organization, and accessibility.

## Features (Planned/Implemented)

* Basic Note Creation (Cue, Note, Summary sections)
* Note Editing
