Today I was able to add some persistent storage to this project so it's not having to log in each time. I had plans of adding a simple check to see if the post was successful depending on where the page lands after the post was made but I'm putting that aside for a moment due to it being a little more complicated than I thought. As of right now I have a working prototype for LinkedIn that needs a little bit of work in terms of where the persistent data is stored. I've almost got a working prototype for the spreadsheet_utils.py file that controls the spreadsheet updates once there is a successful post. My hope is I can use the same template and checks that I am using for LinkedIn on other social media platforms.

```python
import os
import re
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from playwright.sync_api import Playwright, sync_playwright, expect, TimeoutError

# Load environment variables
dotenv_path = "Path for environment variables"
load_dotenv(dotenv_path)

# Persistant data directory
user_data_dir = "Path to persistent data directory"

def run(playwright: Playwright) -> None:
    # Use persistent context
    context = playwright.chromium.launch_persistent_context(
            user_data_dir="data/linkedin_session", # Save session to data folder
            headless=True
            )
    
    # Check if the user is already logged in
    pages = context.pages
    if pages:
        page = pages[0]
    else:
        page = context.new_page()
   
    # Navigate to LinkedIn
    page.goto("https://www.linkedin.com/")

    # If the page is not already on the feed then perform login
    if not page.url.startswith("https://www.linkedin.com/feed"):
        page.get_by_role("link", name="Sign in", exact=True).click()
        page.get_by_role("textbox", name="Email or phone").click()
        page.get_by_role("textbox", name="Email or phone").fill(os.getenv("osenv email variable"))
        page.get_by_role("textbox", name="Email or phone").press("Tab")
        page.get_by_role("textbox", name="Password").fill(os.getenv("osenv password variable"))
        page.get_by_role("button", name="Sign in", exact=True).click()

    # Start post
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Start a post").click()
    page.get_by_role("textbox", name="Text editor for creating").fill("Test")
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Post", exact=True).click()

    # Add message for sucessful post
    # NOTE: Remember that you cannot make the same post twice
    try:
        print("Post was successful!")
    except TimeoutError:
        print("Failed to find 'View post' link after posting.")
    finally:
        context.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)
